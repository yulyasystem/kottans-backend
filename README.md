Happy to be with Kottans again :cupid:
## Unix Shell
I've repereated lots of information connected to shell commands and learned some new.
*Shell* takes commands form keyboard and send it to OS to perform. *Terminal* interacts with shell. 

* `less` lets view the text file
* `file` shows type of file 
* `cp` copies files and directories
* `chmod` change permission to file or dir
