Happy to be with Kottans again :cupid:

## Unix Shell

I've repeated lots of information connected to shell commands and learned some new.
_Shell_ takes commands form keyboard and send it to OS to perform. _Terminal_ interacts with sh

- `less` lets view the text file
- `file` shows type of file
- `cp` copies files and directories
- `chmod` change permission to file or dir

## JavaScript & NodeJS Basics

- `process` object has property `argv` which is array containing complete command-line
- to perform filesystem operations use fs `fs.readFileSync('/path/to/file')`. it will return buffer
- buffer is object to represent arbitrary arrays of data, they can be converted to strings just by calling method `toString()`
